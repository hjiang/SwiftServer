### An example HTTP server in Swift

1. Install a ***development*** snapshot of Swift from: https://swift.org/download/ and make sure its `bin` directory is in your system `PATH`.
    We need the Swift package manager which is not available in the release version.
1. Build and run it.

    ~~~
    $ swift build
    $ .build/debug/SwiftServer
    ~~~
1. Open http://localhost:8080/ on your browser.
